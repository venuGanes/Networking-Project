# Cisco Router & Switch Configuration with Internet Access — Router-on-a-Stick Method

# Objective
To provide a comprehensive, beginner-friendly walkthrough for configuring Cisco routers and switches using the Router-on-a-Stick method, enabling VLAN segmentation, DHCP services, and Internet connectivity for small to medium-sized networks.

# Purpose
I created this to share what I’ve learned about setting up Cisco networking devices in a real-world scenario. This includes configuring VLANs, trunk/access ports, DHCP services, IP addresses, and connecting everything to the internet.
